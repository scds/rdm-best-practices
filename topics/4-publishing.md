## Publishing Data

What do you plan to do with your data once it's been published? How will you ensure that your data remains accessible (to you and others) in the long-term?

Consider the advantages of publishing your datasets in an onlnie repository for preservation and sharing.

## Open Research

Open research is an initiative that you may be familiar with or even have participated in. Some parts of open research include open data, open-source software, open access, and open government.

Not all data can or should be shared. TODO

## What is data sharing?

TODO.

## Why Share Data?

### Citation Impact

Studies show that publications with open data are cited more.
- Publications in PLOS and BMC journals with ope ndata have up to 25% higher citation impact compared to those that don't share data.
- Publications of gene expression microarray data have higher citation impact when the data is shared.

### Journal and Publisher Requirements

Many journals are starting to require data sharing or at least data availability statements, including:
- PLOS
- Nature
- NEJM

Journals with higher impact factors are more likely to have data sharing policies.

### Tri-Agency Requirements

> "Grant recipients are required to deposit into a digital repository all digital research data, metadata and code... in journal publications and pre-prints."

CIHR currently requires researchers to "Deposit bioinformatics, atomic, and molecular coordinate data into the appropriate public database."

SSHRC requires researchers to "make available for use by others all research data collected with the sue of SSHRC funds".

## Open Access (OA) Publishing

Tri-Agency funded research must be published open access. We encourage all research to be published open access when possible!

Online Repositories
- Final manuscripts can be desposited in an institutional or disciplinary repository (such as arXiv.org)
- Researcher is responsible to navigate copyright requirements of the journal

Journals
- Journal provides open access to the article (within 12 months)
- Most journals will charge open access fees

## Persistent Identifiers

Persistend Identifiers (PIDs) help keep track of everything and make research findable. They're are unique links that will never expire.

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)
: Can be minted for publications, datasets, lab equipment, research software and more.

Open Researcher & Contributor ID (ORCiD)
: Unique identifier for researchers. Distinguish yourself from scholars with the same name; connect your datasets, code, and publications.

## Sustainable File Formats

Have you ever saved data on a CD, DVD, or BluRAy? How about a zip disk or HD DVD? Do you use Google Docs or Prezi where all your documents are stored online on a proprietary platform in a proprietary format? What would you do if that platform closed down?

Other researchersmay not have access to any proprietary software you use, so data and metadata should ideally be stored in sustainable formats. Look for formats that are:
- Standardized
- Well documented
- In common usage
- Uncompressed

Research instrument files may be manufacturer specific and should be converted to a sustainable format when possible.

Excel, CSV, Adobe Flash TODO

## Datasets as a Digital Object

Research Output (data/code)
: The data is surrounded by layers of information to make it FAIR

Identifiers
: Persistent unique identifiers such as DOIs and ORCiDs help find, track, and cite data

Standards
: Open standard file formats help others access and reuse data

Metadata
: Rich metadata and data documentation helps others find and understand datasets

## Data Licensing

If you don't have a license for your data or code, it falls under the default copyright laws. This means nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk.

Not having an explicit license restricts others from using your code or data and causes confusion.

- Creative Commons (CC) - (link)
  - CC0 - public domain dedication
  - CC-BY - requires attribution
  - There are further restrictions that can be added such as NC
- Open Data Commons (link)
  - Similar licenses to CC but built for data
  - PDDL - Public Domain Dedication and License
  - ODC-By - require attribution
  - ODbL - attribution and share alike
- Traditional Knowledge (TK)
  - In addition to the First Nations Information Governence Centre's OCAP training, communities may also use TK licenses - (link)

## Community Norms

For data, there are also community norms. Dataverse and Open Data Commons community norms include:
- Sahre your work
- Credit and Cite datasets you use
- Maintain anonymity of human research participants
- Encourage others to reuse data
- Use open formats
- Don't use Digital Rights Management (DRM)

## Where do I put my data?

A data repository is a web platform and storage space for resaerchers to deposit data sets associated with their research.

Repositories provide:
- long-term storage and access to research data beyond the life of a grant, research project, or individual careers.
- discoverability and findability for datasets through features like indexing and DOIs.
- Easy-to-use shared platforms made for research.

Domain Specific Repositories
: Focus on certain types of data such as genomic information or astronomical information.

General Repositories
: Accept broader types of research data. ex. McMaster Dataverse (part of Borealis) and Canada's Federated Research Data REpository (FRDR).

Code Repositories
: There are also code-specific repositories like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and SourceForge

Repository Fidner
: This tool by DataCite can help you find an appropriate repository to deposit your research data: link

### MacSphere
- Institutional repository for scholarly documents (not data).
- A home for all research documents, including publications, presentations, conference proceedings, theses, reports, etc.
- When you graduate you will upload your thesis here.
- Link your dataset DOI!

### McMaster Dataverse
- McMAster's Institutional Data Repository is a home for all research data originating from McMaster researchers.
- Provides basic data curation services.
- Data is stewarded by professionals at McMaster.
- Choose whether to share data openly or through an application process.

### TODO (slides skipped in workshop)

## Key Points / Summary

- Remind the student about what they just learned.
- You can also note down any key information to keep in mind.

## Additional Resources (optional)

- Here, you can list some additional resources the student can access to learn more about this lesson.
