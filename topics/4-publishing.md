## Publishing Data

What do you plan to do with your data once it's been published? How will you ensure that your data remains accessible (to you and others) in the long-term?

Consider the advantages of publishing your datasets in an online repository for preservation and sharing.

## Open Research

Open research is an initiative that allows for others to freely access and contribute to your research. Some parts of open research include open data, open-source software, open access, and open government. You might be familiar with open research and might have even participated in it.  

Open research is often publically funded, and it allows for more transperency, accountability, and reproducibility for other researchers. However, while open research is a wonderful initiative, not all data can or should be shared. 

Any data that can be considered sensitive should not be shared publically. This includes any personally identifiable information, such as medical information or financial records. 

## What is Data Sharing?

### Research Scenario without Data Sharing

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/pub1.png" width="100%">

In a typical scenario, you'll have a researcher or research team who would have just finished their research process. As a result of their research, they'll have gathered a bunch of research data which is then used in a publication or journal. The research data, however, is not made available publically.

</div>

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/pub2.png" width="100%">

Once the research goes through a peer review process, you might be able to send the data directly to the researchers for them to analyze. More commonly however, you'll see the phrase "data available on request". In practice, there's often big delays to receive data in this manner, and it can be quite difficult to contact the researcher as well.

</div>

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/pub3.png" width="100%">

Later on, another researcher or research team might contact the original researcher for the research data, so that they can build upon it or use it as part of their own research. However, original researcher might be hard to contact or they might not longer have access to the data. This can make it hard for researchers to trust the paper's findings without the original data to back it up, and this can even lead to article retractions.

</div>

### Research Scenario with Data Sharing

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/pub1.png" width="100%">

In a data sharing scenario, the process starts the exact same way. A researcher or research would have finished their research process and publish their findings.

</div>

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/pub4.png" width="100%">

However, in this context, the researcher deposits their data into a trusted data repository. Now, the data is easily accessible by researchers.

</div>

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/pub5.png" width="100%">

Any researchers part of the peer review process can easily access the data... but then any other researchers can also verify the data easily.

</div>

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/pub6.png" width="100%">

Now that the research data is easily accessible, a researchers could use it to interpret the data in their own way, or perhaps another researcher can use the data alongside their own data to publish another paper. The original researcher can also come back and make new reflections on the original data.

All of this leads to further citations, collaborations, and partnership, which is a benefit to you as well as the research community.

## Why Share Data?

### Citation Impact

Studies show that publications with open data are cited more.
- Publications in PLOS and BMC journals with open data have up to 25% higher citation impact compared to those that don't share data. [^1]
- Publications of gene expression microarray data have higher citation impact when the data is shared. [^2]

[^1]: Collavazi et al, 2020 PLOSOne The citation advantage of linking publications to research data <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230416>
[^2]: Piwowar & Vision, 2013 PeerJ Data reuse and the open data citation advantage <https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.175>

### Journal and Publisher Requirements

Many journals are starting to require data sharing or at least data availability statements, including:
- PLOS - <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability>
- Nature - <https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio/editorial-policies/reporting-standards>
- NEJM - <https://www.nejm.org/about-nejm/editorial-policies>

Journals with higher impact factors are more likely to have data sharing policies.

### Tri-Agency Requirements

> "Grant recipients are required to deposit into a digital repository all digital research data, metadata and code... in journal publications and pre-prints."

CIHR currently requires researchers to "Deposit bioinformatics, atomic, and molecular coordinate data into the appropriate public database."

SSHRC also requires researchers to "make available for use by others all research data collected with the sue of SSHRC funds".

To find out more about the Tri-Agency data requirements, check out "[What you need to know about the Tri-Agency RDM Policy](https://scds.github.io/intro-rdm/triagency.html)" and the "[Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-research-data-management-policy)".

## Open Access (OA) Publishing

The Tri-Agency is requiring any publically funded research to be published open access. We encourage all research to be published open access when possible!

### Online Repositories
- Final manuscripts can be desposited in an institutional or disciplinary repository (such as [arXiv.org](https://arXiv.org))
- Researcher is responsible to navigate copyright requirements of the journal, but there are lots of resources available and the library can assist you if you need help.

### Journals
- Journal provides open access to the article (within 12 months)
- Most journals will charge open access fees

## Persistent Identifiers

Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) help keep track of everything and make research findable. They're unique links that will never expire.

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)
: Can be minted for publications, datasets, lab equipment, research software and more.

Open Researcher & Contributor ID (ORCiD)
: Unique identifier for researchers. Distinguish yourself from scholars with the same name; connect your datasets, code, and publications.

If you're interested in learning more, check out:
- "[Set yourself up for research success: Manage your data like a pro, and get your own ORCiD profile](https://scds.github.io/intro-rdm/researchsuccess.html)"
- "[What are ORCiDs and DOIsâ€”and Why Do I Need Them?](https://scds.github.io/intro-rdm/doi-orcid.html)"

## Sustainable File Formats

Have you ever saved data on a CD, DVD, or BluRay? How about a zip drive or HD DVD? Do you use Google Docs or Prezi where all your documents are stored online on a proprietary platform in a proprietary format? What would you do if that platform closed down?

Other researcher smay not have access to any proprietary software you use, so data and metadata should ideally be stored in sustainable formats. Look for formats that are:
- Standardized
- Well documented
- In common usage
- Uncompressed

Research instrument files may be manufacturer specific and should be converted to a sustainable format when possible.

## Datasets as a Digital Object

When sharing your datasets, you should share your:

## Data Licensing

If you license your data or code, it falls under the default copyright laws. This means nobody else can copy, distribute, or modify your work without being at risk.

Not having an explicit license restricts others from using your code or data and causes confusion.

- Creative Commons (CC) - [creativecommons.org](https://creativecommons.org/)
  - CC0 - public domain dedication
  - CC-BY - requires attribution
  - There are further restrictions that can be added such as NC
- Open Data Commons - [opendatacommons.org](https://opendatacommons.org/)
  - Similar licenses to CC but built for data
  - PDDL - Public Domain Dedication and License
  - ODC-By - require attribution
  - ODbL - attribution and share alike
- Traditional Knowledge (TK) - [localcontexts.org/licenses](https://localcontexts.org/licenses)
  - In addition to the First Nations Information Governence Centre's OCAP training, communities may also use TK licenses.

## Community Norms

For data, there are also community norms. Dataverse and Open Data Commons community norms include:
- Share your work
- Credit and Cite datasets you use
- Maintain anonymity of human research participants
- Encourage others to reuse data
- Use open formats
- Don't use Digital Rights Management (DRM)

## Where do I put my data?

A data repository is a web platform and storage space for researchers to deposit datasets associated with their research.

Repositories provide:
- long-term storage and access to research data beyond the life of a grant, research project, or individual careers.
- discoverability and findability for datasets through features like indexing and DOIs.
- easy-to-use shared platforms made for research.

There are thousands of data repositories available for you to use. A few types of repositories include:

Domain Specific Repositories
: Focus on certain types of data such as genomic information or astronomical information.

General Repositories
: Accept broader types of research data. ex. McMaster Dataverse (part of Borealis) and Canada's Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR).

Code Repositories
: There are also code-specific repositories like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and SourceForge

DataCite provides a tool that can help you find an appropriate repository to deposit your research data: [repositoryfinder.datacite.org](https://commons.datacite.org/repositories)

### MacSphere

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/macsphere.jpg" width="30%">

MacSphere is McMaster's institutional repository, and it is the home for all scholarly documents, including publications, presentations, converence proceedings, theses, reports, and more.

This is where you'll upload your thesis once you graduate. Make sure to link your dataset DOI if you have relevant research data.

You can access MacSphere by going to [macsphere.mcmaster.ca/](https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/).

### McMaster Dataverse

McMaster Dataverse, on the other hand, is McMaster's institutional data repository. This is the home for all research data originating from McMaster researchers.

The McMaster Dataverse provides basic data curation services. The data is also stewarded by professionals in McMaster.

On McMaster Dataverse, you can choose whether to share data openly or through an application process.

You can access the McMaster Dataverse by going to [borealisdata.ca/dataverse/mcmaster](https://borealisdata.ca/dataverse/mcmaster).

If you're interested in using the McMaster Dataverse, check out [Depositing & Sharing Data Online with McMaster Dataverse](https://scds.github.io/intro-rdm/dataverse.html).

### Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR)

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/frdrlogo.png" width="60%">

Another great option is the FRDR, which is available to any researcher affiliated with a Canadian institution. 

It's build for large datasets (1 TB+). The datasets are actively curated by professional staff at the FRDR.

The FRDR requires datasets to be open access, but they can be embargoed for a one-year period. For those working with sensitive data, the FRDR are working on a pilot project to add an optional zero knowledge encryption to their repository, meaning that the FRDR will never be able to access the data. This allows you to deposit your data in a trusted data repository for archival but maintain complete control over access to the data. 

If you're interested in piloting this service, email us at [rdm@mcmaster.ca](emailto:rdm@mcmaster.ca)

## Key Points / Summary

- Data sharing is important for data preservation and is an overall benefit to the research community.
- Many journals and funders require data to be open.
- There are over 1000 data repositories you can choose from to upload your data. MacSphere and McMaster Dataverse are McMaster's institutional repositories.
