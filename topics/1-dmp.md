# Data Management Plans (DMPs)
Data Management Plans are used to plan, organize, and document how you're going to use your data throughout your research project.

<!-- This is your table of contents. You don't need to touch it, it automatically creates it when you add or remove headers. If you do not want a header to be included, put {: .no_toc } above the header line, as you can see above with Lesson 1 - Lesson Name. Make sure that there's also an empty line above {: .no_toc }...

## What is a Data Management Plan?

A Data Management Plan (DMP) is a living document describing your plan for how you will manage your research data. As a living document, this will be something you'll work with as you go through your research process and adapt as things change during your research. 

The best time to start making your DMP is at the start of your research. It's meant to be a proactive process that helps you anticipate and identify opportunities and challenges in managing your data before they emerge, so that you're under a little less pressure during your research. 

A good DMP covers the management of data both **during** the active phases of your research and **after** the completion of the research project. 

Research almost always a team effort. DMPs are a great way to get on the same page as collaborators. If you're working as team, discuss and develop your DMP with anyone who will be part of collecting, analyzing, and storing the data: research assistants, coordinators, and other staff. This can become part of your onboarding workflow. If you're a graduate student, your supervisor can review and comment on your DMP. If you're working with research participants, your DMP could be reviewed by community leadership, partner organizations, and the participants themselves--this is especially important for Indigenous research data. As ever, the many staff who support research can also contribute: RDM professionals, IT units, archivists and librarians, research offices, ethics boards, and more. 

Some research funders require grant applicants to submit a DMP. In the US, the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/data-management-plan) and the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://sharing.nih.gov/data-management-and-sharing-policy) both require DMPs (or a variant) to be submitted with the grant application. The [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/how-complete-outputs-management-plan) in the UK also requires a DMP, as do a lot of the other European funders. Recently, the [Tri-Agency (SSHRC, NSERC, and CIHR)​](https://science.gc.ca/site/science/en/interagency-research-funding/policies-and-guidelines/research-data-management/tri-agency-research-data-management-policy) has also started requiring DMPs as part of grant applications.

## What goes in a Data Management Plan?

Pretty much anything that pertains to your research data will go into your data management plan. More specifically:

    <tr>

        <li>What types of data will you collect?</li>

## DMP Assistant

The best way to build a Data Management Plan is to use [DMP Assistant](https://assistant.portagenetwork.ca/).

DMP Assistant is a web-based data management planning tool that's available to all researchers in Canada for free.

After making an account and logging in to the website, DMP Assistant will ask you a series of questions about your data management practices. By answering these questions, you are essentially filling in and creating your data management plan.

The website offers lots of data management guidance and links, including McMaster-specific guidance on what kind of resources are available to you here. At the end, you're able to export your document into a PDF document, a Word document, or just about any other format you'd like.

You can also add collaborators or other researchers to the site so that you can work on the DMP together.

To check out DMP Assistant, you can go to <https://assistant.portagenetwork.ca/>.

McMaster RDM Services has developed a "McMaster General Purpose DMP Template" which has specific guidance for services and resources at our university. Just click the "Write Plan" button and click on the "Comments and Guidance" sidebar in each section.

<img src="../assets/img/lessons/dmp-guidance.PNG" width="100%" style="border: solid 2px black">

We also offer a full workshop on Data Management Plans and using DMP Assistant. You can find that here: <https://scds.github.io/intro-rdm/dmp.html>.
