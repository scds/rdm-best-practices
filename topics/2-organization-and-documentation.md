## Organize and Document your Data

Raw data isn't easy to understand and re-use. Raw numbers in a spreadsheet can be hard to interpret, and variable names can have abbreviations that make it hard for others to understand what it truly is.

Adding data documentation can support the reusability of your research for other researchers, and it can also help you understand what is going on.

Data documentation also supports interoperability, which will potentially help you and others integrate that data with other datasets.

Some key questions:
- If you need need to data you collected over a year ago, how easy would they be to find and use?
- Would you know what every variable is?
- Would you have information about when/where/how the data was collected?
- Have you ever gone to analyze data or publish a paper only to find that some critical piece of information was not recorded, or you don't remember where you wrote it down?

This is all really important to consider, especially these days, because journals are increasingly thinking about research reproducibility.

## Research Project Management

When doing your research, there are a lot of software packages and tools that can make your life easier.

Collaboration
: Google Docs and Microsoft Office let your team work documents in real-time, avoiding multiple versions and copies sent by email.

Reference Management
: Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote support collaboration through shared citation libraries. McMaster provides a paid license to EndNote for free for everyone on campus.

Notetaking Software
: Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Notion, or an Electronic Lab Notebook allow you to create organized, linked notes that you can use to document your research practices

Open Science Framework (OSF)
: This free platform for research collaboration lets you manage files, data, code, and protocols in one central location.

## File Organization

Something very basic that we sometimes slack on is keeping files organized. The key to organizing files is to make it a habit.

Keeping your files organized makes it easier to know where files are and where new files should go.

File organization schemes include: 
- By project
- By researcher
- By experiment type
- By date (often year)
- By some combination of the above
  - ie a two level structure of year -> project

## File Naming

Once you've come up with a good folder structure, you can start giving your files good names.

Organizing your research files makes your data easier to understand, share, and archive - both now and in the future. A good file organization system should be descriptive, standardized, and implemented consistently.

Some key things that you might want to include in a file name include a date, a reference to the project, perhaps a short description, and maybe even the initials of the researcher that created the file. Version numbers and even locations are sometimes included as well.

The goal of file naming is to make your files easy to search for, and easy to understand.

<div markdown="1" class="code-example">
*e.g. 2022_10_01_LakeMercury_TestData1_TM_v3.csv*

The file name above includes:
- Date: 2022_10_01 (collection date)
- Project Name: LakeMercury
- Short Description: TestData1
- Name: TM (Tracy MacDern)
- Version Number: v3

Without even having seen or worked on this file, you can easily understand what it is.

{: .note-title}
> Tip
>
> If you write dates at the start of your files with the year, month, and day (in that order), the file system on your computer will automatically organize them by date when you're sorting your files alphabetically.

Once you've established a file organization and naming system, describe it in a README file for your research project and make sure everyone on your research team knows the system.

## Documentation Files

Once you have file names, and you have folder organization, you can start to think about documentation files.

Documentation files come in a number of different formats.

README
: A simple text document (.txt) that describes project information, folder hierarchy and file organization, description of important file contents.

Data Dictionaries
: A document for tabular data that describes names, labels, units, and contraints

Codebooks
: Like data dictionaries but for suvery or statistical data - includes the survey layout and structure, and codes for questions and answers.

> The most important aspect of documentation is doing it.
> 
> Whatever file naming and organization scheme you choose, make sure it's descriptive, use it consistently, and document it (in a README.txt file).
>
> Take advantage of the software that is out there, including note-taking software, reference management software, and collaboration software.
