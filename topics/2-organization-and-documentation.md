## Organize and Document your Data

Raw data isn't easy to understand and re-use. Data documentation supports interoperability and reusability.

- If you need need to data you collected over a year ago, how easy would they be to find and use?
- Would you know what every variable is?
- Would you have information about when/where/how the data was collected?
- Have you ever gone to analyze data or publish a paper only to find that some critical piece of information was not recorded, or you don't remember where you wrote it down?

## Research Project Management

When doing your research, there are a lot of software packages and tools that can make your life easier.

Collaboration
: Google Docs and Microsoft Office let your team work documents in real-time, avoiding multiple versions and copies sent by email.

Reference Management
: Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote support collaboration through shared citation libraries.

Notetaking Software
: Obsidian, Evernote, OneNote, Notion, or an Electronic Lab Notebook allow you to create organized, linked notes that you can use to document your research practices

Open Science Framework (OSF)
: This free platform for research collaboration lets you manage files, data, code, and protocols in one central location.
